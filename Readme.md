## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up your environment to run the project.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You can install all the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies directly using:

pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow matplotlib scikit-image keras tkinter PIL


Here is a basic README.md template for your GitHub project, "Satellite Image Dehazing using the AOD-Net Architecture". This template includes a general overview, installation guide, and execution instructions which you can refine according to your project specifics.
